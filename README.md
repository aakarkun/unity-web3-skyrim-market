In this project basically we are marrying Web2 and Web3 Gaming. We're using PlayFab as a backend for the in-game currency and for displaying items in stores. Then we add the power of Web3 through Moralis to convert these Web2 items to the actual NFTs.

We do that by having different shops in the market. In the Exchange one you can trade Crystal (PlayFab currency) for Septim (ERC-20 token). Then, with that Septim, you can buy NFT Outfits at the Outfit Shop.

Once we own the NFT Outfits, we'll display them in the player‚Äôs inventory and we'll be able to change the player look by selecting each one of them :)
